INTRODUCTION

A event-driven GUI for SDL made for yujinwunz's shenanigans.

It features:
-controls including
	-button
	-form
	-scroll bar
	-radio button
	-checkbox
	-label
	-textbox
-event driven environment
-overridable drawing

It is object oriented, everything is inheritable/overridable

Note that there are much better GUI's out there for SDL; this one was coded for the sake of coding.


FILES

the /Source/ directory contains all the code for the controls.
the /Source/Examples/ directory contains example main programs that use these

Working compiled versions of the examples can be downloaded on the GitHub page. The compiled executables has been tested under windows 7.
